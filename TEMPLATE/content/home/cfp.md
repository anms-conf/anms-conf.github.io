Beyond 5G and 6G wireless systems are expected to handle significantly increased data rates, provide ultra-low latency and enhanced connectivity to massive numbers of devices, and bring improvements in network energy efficiency. This new generation of networking systems aims to be fully autonomous networks (AN) with management capabilities, such as self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimizing, and self-evolving aspects, that todayâ€™s networks do not support as their management is largely manual with some automated assistance.
 
This workshop focuses on novel research in algorithms, architectures, approaches, and applications in the autonomous management of 5G and 6G systems. We encourage original paper submissions from academia and industry presenting work in progress or novel research on the most recent advances, frameworks, models, and approaches for management of autonomous networks using enabling techniques, such as AI/ML, virtualisation, and blockchain. We are also interested in articles revising the state-of-the-art of this topic, showing recent major advances and discoveries, significant gaps in the research, current standardization status, and new future issues. 

**We invite submissions of original research papers, as well as vision papers and experience reports.**
