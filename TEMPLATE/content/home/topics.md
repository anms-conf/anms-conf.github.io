The aim of the workshop is to share new findings, exchange ideas and discuss research challenges on the following topics (not an exhaustive list):  

- Self-* techniques of network management in AN
- Network resource and service automation and orchestration in AN
- Network state prediction and forecasting for AN
- Network monitoring systems (traffic recognition, anomaly detection, etc.) for AN
- Intelligent network service provisioning and assurance in AN
- Methods and algorithms for resource allocation and usage in AN
- AN management in resource-constrained environments
- Adaptation and customization of AI for constrained devices (e.g. edge) for control in AN
- Efficient resource allocation and scheduling (e.g., spectrum, storage, compute) in AN
- Tools, simulators, or digital twins for planning, validation, and what-if analysis in AN
- Architectures and frameworks to integrate AI natively in AN
- Generation and use of knowledge-graphs for AN use cases
- Taxonomies of explainability of AI decisions for AN use cases
- The role and usefulness of LLMâ€™s in AN and intent
- Novel contributions on low carbon and sustainability in AN
- Blockchain and distributed ledger technology for AN management and trust
- Security provision and its integration with AN
- End-to-end management of AN
- Decentralised and distributed AI for management and operation in AN
- Autonomous management of access and interaction for the radio spectrum
- Autonomous management via AI-native approaches and use cases across the network
